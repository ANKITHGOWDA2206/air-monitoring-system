# air-monitoring-system
ML project for identifying air quality index
The Air Monitoring System is an IoT and Machine Learning–based project designed to monitor, predict, and analyze air quality in real time. By combining sensor data with ML models, this system detects pollution levels, identifies anomalies, and provides actionable insights for healthier environments.
